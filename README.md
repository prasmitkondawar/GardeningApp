# GreenThumb

GreenThumb is a gardening app which allows users to store their plants and treat them as pets. Using our infrasture, consumers should treat taking care of their plants as a fun thing, not a chore.

## Features

- Users can upload photos of their plants, assign custom names, and manage them in a personal plant directory.
- A built‑in calendar and care scheduler automatically determines watering days, generating to‑dos so users don’t need to input care data manually.
- Account management is powered by OTP email verification for secure and simple sign-in.
- Integrated AI-powered plant identification uses OpenAI’s vision model to recognize plant species and recommend care frequency.

## Softwares
- Frontend: React Native with TypeScript, built with Expo Go for mobile deployment.
- Backend: Go (Golang) with RESTful API implementation.
- AI Integration: OpenAI Vision Model for plant recognition and automated care suggestions.
- Infrastructure:
  - Fully containerized architecture with Docker.
  - Hosted on Render.com for auto-scaling and streamlined deployment.
